# See-Sharp-Regexes

This is an interpreted programming language made as a joke that had once the name of "TAR". This programming language is made for the sole purpose to replace an input with a set of multiple regex following some conditions defined prior to the replacement.


## FAQ

#### How do I use it?

Well you see, that's the fun part... This project is not done and will never be, I am currently working on a cleaned-up reimplementation in C++ to balance out performance and how strong it supports errors.

#### Why is this code such a mess?

As said in the question stated above, this is not meant to be taken seriously, it is an hobbyist project made for the sole goal of memeing it and understanding how to implement a new language in an already existing one.
